## About 

PILOS is the complete system for the video conference in class and group learning, which has been in use at the THM Faculty of Health ([FB GES](https://www.thm.de/ges/)) since the summer semester 2020.
It is based on [BigBlueButton](https://bigbluebutton.org/) and [Greenlight](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/greenlight).

Greenlight has been adapted to the requirements of the teachers from THM Faculty of Health and will be further developed in this repository.
The configuration of BigBlueButton is quickly adapted via a script.

This project is currently working on the conversion of the Greenlight client, which is based on the [Ruby-On-Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) framework, to the [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) framework.
